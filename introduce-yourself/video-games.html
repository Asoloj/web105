            <h2>Video Games</h2>
            <p>Like any teenager these days, I love my video games.  I don't have much time to play recently 
                because of school, but ocassionally I'll hop on my Xbox (which is better than PS4) every now and then.
                For the most part I play FPS games, but sometimes I'll pick up a random story game.  Before I had an Xbox
                I used to play all kinds of games on the 'ol Nintendo Gamecube. Below are some of the games that 
                I'm playing currently.

            <div class="row">
                <div class="column">
                    <img src="apex-legends.jpg" alt="Apex Legends" class="center" style="width: 600px; height: 350px;">
                    <p>Apex is the game I play most often.  It's a first-person battle royale, and my favorite battle royale by far.
                        My main is Wraith, though I play the other characters too.
                    </p>
                    <img src="modern-warfare.jpg" alt="Modern Warfare" class="center" style="width:600px; height: 380px;">
                    <p>I've always enjoyed the Call of Duty franchise, and Modern Warfare is no exception.
                        I stick to multiplayer, as I'm terrible at Modern Warfare's battle royale, Warzone.
                        Lately I've just been grinding completionist camos for snipers and smgs.
                    </p>
                    <img src="control.jpg" alt="Control" class="center" style="width: 600px; height: 350px;">
                    <p>One of the rare times I play a story game, Control has been an absolutely fantastic experience.
                        The game came out in August 2019, and while I've finished the main story, I'm still working on one of the two expansions,
                        AWE.  This game is super unique and a ton of fun, I highly reccomend it.
