            <h2>Graphic Design</h2>
            <p>My career of choice and my passion, I only fell in love with graphic design after I took
                a graphic design class at MCC as an elective.  After that, I knew that was what I wanted to do.  I originally
                was doing just an Associates Degree in Graphic Design, but I recently changed that to the Graphic Design Certificate Program.
                I've also started learning how to draw digitally, which is super fun.
                I'll post some pictures of work I've done in class, as well as some random stuff I've done just for fun.
