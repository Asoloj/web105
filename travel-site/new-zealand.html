            <h2>New Zealand</h2>
            <p>New Zealand is another place I'd really like to visit.  It looks like a beautiful country, and
                I'd love to explore it someday.  New Zealand's population is 4.5 million.
            </p>

            <p>A big reason I want to travel to new Zealand is because that's where the set of Hobbiton is from 
                one of my favorite movie series, Lord of the Rings.  When I found out where those scenes were 
                filmed, I have always wanted to visit.
            </p>

            <p>New Zealand consists of two main islands, The North Island and the South Island.
                Surrounding these are aroundf 600 smller islands, covering a total aera of about 103,000 square miles.

                <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
                While filming the Lord of the Rings, the frogs in the nearby ponds
                got too loud.  Director Peter Jackson paid someone to move the frogs
                to a different pond on the farm.
