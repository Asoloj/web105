            <h2>Exploring the world</h2>
            <p>Traveling is somehting everyone should do at least once in their life.  Traveling is an opportunity to see other places,
                explore and get out of your comfort zone.  Everyone should venture out and explore the world, there's so much to see and 
                so little time to see it!
            </p>
            <p>Traveling can be an escape from the everyday, ordinary mundane life, and something new to explore.
                There's something exciting about planning a trip, planning activitites, and packing the night before you leave
                because you forgot all about it.
